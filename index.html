<h3>What we're about.</h3>
<p>We're about reading books and discussing thing about the book. The book club is a fun and easy way to relax while discussing good books. If you like the book we read you can read others like it on your own time. We meet once a month and everybody is assgined the same book. When we meet the book people were assigned is discussed. We meet in the school library after school. This is found to be a convenient place for students to be able to discuss the book. Since the library is in the school it'se easier for people to meet at the school. If you have any suggestions for what the book club should read you should contact me so I can implement the suggestions into action. If people like the suggestion then everybody can read the book and discuss it later one once we meet. Reading isn't all bad, it can also be made fun and very entertaing if you do it right.</p>
